description = "The Vermintide Mod Framework (VMF) is an open-source, community-run framework of modules that provides enhanced modding capabilities and support. The framework is designed to be both independent and lightweight; making no changes to gameplay on its own.

Mods created for the project may utilize:
[list]
    [*]Mod options
    [*]Shared function hooks
    [*]Chat commands
    [*]Keybinds
    [*]Mutator support
    [*]Network calls
    [*]QHD+ UI re-scaling
    [*]Rewritten, lightweight mod functions
    [*]An on-event call system
[/list]

The Vermintide Mod Framework originally started in Warhammer End Times: Vermintide as an unofficial modding platform. In the time since, VMF has been rewritten and redesigned with contributions from many unique members of the community; culminating in this unified project made for the arrival of official mod support.
